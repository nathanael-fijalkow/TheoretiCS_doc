# TheoretiCS Survival Kit for Editors

> Authors: Antoine Amarilli, Javier Esparza, Nathanaël Fijalkow, Uri Zwick

This document is intended for TheoretiCS editors as a survival kit.
If you want a quick reference of the
workflow, have a look at the flowchart for [phase 1](editors-phase1.pdf) and [phase 2](editors-phase2.pdf).

## Three features to keep in mind

The reviewing process at TheoretiCS differs from the one followed
by most journals in three aspects, which you should keep in mind.

### Two-phase reviewing

TheoretiCS has a two-phase review system. 
* The expected total duration of Phase 1 is ***THREE MONTHS***. 
The only two possible outcomes of this phase are: 
> Accept for phase 2 / Reject

* Papers accepted for the second-phase are eventually accepted, unless something (hopefully) unusual happens: errors are found, or  authors are unable or unwilling to implement reasonable changes requested by reviewers.

* Phase 2 runs according to the standard loop of reviews and revisions. The possible outcomes 
of each iteration are:
> Accept / Major Revision / Minor Revision / Reject

### Collective responsibility for acceptance / rejection

Unless they have a [conflict of interest](https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/conflict-of-interest-policy), all members of the Editorial Board can see all articles,
comment on them, support the decisions proposed by the editors assigned to a paper, or raise objections.
In particular, editors do not directly accept/reject papers, they propose a decision 
to the Editorial Board instead. Acceptance and rejection decisions are always
implemented by the Editors-in-chief following the outcome of the discussion,
they are not implemented by editors directly.

### Two editors per paper

Each paper is assigned to two editors: the **handling editor**, who
is responsible for the paper, and the **partner editor**, who
assists the handling editor, and for example can be consulted 
regarding challenging decisions.
