# TheoretiCS Survival Kit for Editors

> Authors: Managing editors and Editors-in-chief

This document is intended for TheoretiCS editors as a survival kit.
If you want a quick reference of the
workflow, have a look at the flowchart for [phase 1](editors-phase1.pdf) and [phase 2](editors-phase2.pdf).

## Where to find help

Email the [managing editors: Mikaël Monet and David Purser](mailto:managing-editors@theoretics-journal.org)

## Features to keep in mind

The reviewing process at TheoretiCS differs from the one followed
by most journals in three aspects, which you should keep in mind.

### Two-phase reviewing

TheoretiCS has a two-phase review system. Phase 1 and Phase 2.

* How papers progress between phases 
  - At each phase:  after the two editors have reached agreement, the handling editor proposes a recommendation by adding a comment (with some justification).
  - Every recommendation is communicated via the weekly digest to the EB. 
  - All member of the EB can see all articles (unless they have a [conflict of interest](https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/policies)) and  are invited to discuss the recommendation on the article management page: comment on them, support the decisions proposed by the editors assigned to a paper, or raise objections.
  - Acceptance, rejection and move to phase 2 decisions are always communicated to the authors by the editors-in-chief following the outcome of the discussion, they are not implemented by editors directly.

* The expected total duration of Phase 1 is ***THREE MONTHS***. 
The only two possible outcomes of this phase are:   
*Accept for phase 2 / Reject*

* Revisions never happen *during* Phase 1 (it should not be needed to judge the significance and lasting value). Papers can be asked for a revision **between Phase 1 and Phase 2** (but it is considered to have passed Phase 1). *This request is issued by the EiC alongside the move to Phase 2.*

* Papers accepted for the second-phase are eventually accepted, unless something (hopefully) unusual happens: errors are found, or  authors are unable or unwilling to implement reasonable changes requested by reviewers.

* Phase 2 runs according to the standard loop of reviews and revisions. The possible outcomes 
of each iteration are:   
  *Accept / Major Revision / Minor Revision / Reject*  
  Revisions during phase 2 are handled by the editors.  
  Proposals to Accept or Reject are made as recommendations noted above.

### Communication

Please communicate between editors using the "Editors comments" system on the article management page. This helps keep the discussion in one place and helps the Editors-in-chief and managing editors know that the paper is progressing.

To communicate with the author, under “Contributor”, click on the envelope icon.

### Review invitations

When issuing a review there are few things to keep in mind:

* Check whether the potential review already has an account within TheoretiCS or episciences during the review invitation process.

* Keep the correct part of the email template relevant to Phase 1 or Phase 2. 

* To invite a review to check a revision in Phase 2 there is no specific template, and you will need to write an appropriate message.


### Two editors per paper

Each paper is assigned to two editors: the **handling editor**, who
is responsible for the paper, and the **partner editor**, who
assists the handling editor, and for example can be consulted 
regarding challenging decisions.
