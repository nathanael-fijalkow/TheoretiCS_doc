1) Author submits paper

Submission triggers this message (non-customizable)
to the EiCs and managing editors

TEMPLATE:  Submission: Submitted article - Author copy

I have changed the template so that it explains the two-phase review systems, 
says that the first phase is expected to take at most 3 months, and that the 
author will be contacted again when the editor has been selected.

1.1)  EiC or Managing editor (WHO??) moves paper to Phase 1.

2) EiC assigns managing and partner editors


2.1 EiC clicks on Assign Editors, and selects first the handling
and then the partner editor.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This triggers the (non-customizable) message to the editors

TEMPLATE:  Papers-editors assignment: Assign an editor

I've changed this template. The email says almost nothing, 
only that the EB member has got a new assignment. See 2.2.

2.2 EiC writes two. *ad hoc* emails to the managing and partner
editors, within the system. 
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is done by clicking on the email iconsof handling and partner editors.

The emails explain

- the two-phase review
- the roles of handling and partner editors

and give the editors instructions for 
- login, 
- how to communicate between them (through comments?)
etc. 

Here is a possible text for the message:

********************************
Ad-hoc email from EiC to Editors
********************************

--------- VERSION FOR HANDLING EDITOR ------

Subject: theoretics #????: Handling editor

TITLE: XX

Dear YY:


I would like you to act as handling editor of the above submission to TheoretiCS. 

Please login to your editor accounts to start the review process.
Click on "Dashboard" and then on the title of the paper to access
the paper's page.

Your partner editor is ZZ. You can discuss any action with your partner editor,
and the two of you must agree on your final recommendation (see below).

Please communicate with your partner editor through the system if at all
possible, either by writing comments in the paper's page or by
email (click on the mail icon to the right of the name of the editor in the
paper's page). Your partner editor receives the same emails as you from the system.

If you haven't assigned at least two reviewers to the paper within two weeks you 
will start to get automatic reminders. Notice that you can 
assign yourself and/or your partner editor.

Recall that TheoretiCS follows a two-phase reviewing process. 
In the first phase, you and your partner editor, usually after seeking the opinion 
of reviewers, agree on a recommedation: Accept for the second phase, or reject.
The main criteria are the significance of the results, the belief that the exposition 
is of high quality or will be so after revision, and the availability of expert reviewers. 
The paper moves to the second phase after approval by the Editorial Board. 

I would like to ask you to conclude this first phase before

            ****** Date ***** (about current date + 10 weeks)

In the second phase, possibly different reviewers check the validity of the results and the
presentation. Submissions that pass the first phase are expected to eventually be 
published, sometimes in revised form, unless significant issues are detected or the desired 
quality of exposition is not achieved.

Dear YY:

I would like you to act as partner editor of the above submission to TheoretiCS. 
The handling editor, %%...%%, is in charge of conducting the review process,
in collaboration with you, and you must make a joint recommendation. 

To access the paper, log into your editor account,
click on "Dashboard", and then on the title of the paper.

2.3 EiC writes a comment 
------------------------

With text:

"Managing Editor: X Partner Editor: Y"

so that the information about which is which is visible in the 
page of the submission.


************************************************************************

We have agreed to the following:

- Editors do not have to acknowledge accepting to handle the paper.

- Editors get an automatic reminders if they haven't assigned 
at least two reviewers after two weeks.

- EiCs inform authors of who is the handling editor. They do so when 
they think it's clear that the handling editor has accepted the 
paper (probably because reviewers have already been assigned).

- Authors can suggest one editor.

COMMENT: The system uses two different templates, depending on whether
the chosen editor is the one suggested by the authors or not
(probably because if the message mentions that the authors suggested the editor,
then the editor is more likely to accept, it's "the natural candidate").
I have changed the texts so that in both cases the editor gets the same
message.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


3) Handling/partner editors assign reviewers

Handling/partner editor invites a reviewer by clicking on "Invite Reviewer".
Depending on whether the reviewer has already reviewed or not,
and has an account of not, the system sends one of these three
messages, that can be customzed before they are sent:

TEMPLATE: Reviewing - Invite a user to review an article - existing user 

or

TEMPLATE: Reviewing - Invite a user to review an article - user does not have an account yet

or

TEMPLATE: Reviewing - Invite a user to review an article - existing reviewer

I have modified the templates so that they have two versions 
for the first and second phases. They look like this:

----- KEEP THIS TEXT ONLY FOR FIRST-PHASE REVIEW ---------
Text
------------- END OF TEXT FOR FIRST-PHASE REVIEW -------------

------ KEEP THIS TEXT ONLY FOR SECOND-PHASE REVIEW ---------
Text
--------- END OF TEXT FOR SECOND-PHASE REVIEW -------------

-------- KEEP THE TEXT BELOW FOR BOTH PHASES --------------
Text

The editors *must* delete the part that does not correspond. 
They can customize the text further if they wish.

I have set the "Default rating delay" to 4 weeks. The messages
use this for the deadline of the first phase. That is, a
Phase-1-reviewer is given one month for a review as default.

(I've also set the Minimum and Maximum rating delays to 2
days and 8 weeks. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO!!

The Delay before invitation expires is 1 month. This is probably
too long for a Phase-1-review, but it has to work for both 
Phase-1 and Phase-2 reviewers ...)


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


4) Reviewers review paper

There is a common rating grid for reviewers, which looks like this:

FILL ONLY THE PHASE 1 OR PHASE 2 PART

--------------------------------
Phase 1 review (quick review)

Rating (Accept/reject)

Report

Confidential comments for the editors

Would you be available for a second-phase review? (Yes/No/Maybe)
----------------------------------
Phase 2 review (standard review)

Rating (Accept(Minor revision/Major revision/Reject)

Report

Confidential comments for the editors

Would you like to see the revised version?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The duplication is necessary for the case (which might be quite common) 
that a Phase 1 reviewer also acts as reviewer in phase 2. In this case
the reviewer will first fill the Phase 1 part and then, later, the
Phase 2 part (see below)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


5) Handling/partner editors make recommendation

Handling editor changes the article status, choosing one of

I recommend to accept the article
I suggest to reject the article


PROBLEM: 

- The options should be "move to second phase" and "reject".
Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to do this.

- Editors also see another two options:
"ask for a minor revision" and "ask for a major revision".
They shouldn't choose them in the first phase. (If they do,
they directly send a message to the authors, and then it's
too late.)

Unfortunately, it seems that we cannot edit these texts to
"Choose only in phase 2: Ask for a minor revision"
"Choose only in phase 2: Ask for a major revision"

TODO: EXPLAIN THIS ISSUE TO EDITORS!!!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


6) EiCs communicate result of first phase to authors


6.1) If EiC rejects he just choosees the Reject option.

Otherwise, EiC proceeds to notif the authors, sending them the reviews.
There are two possibilities for this:

a) EiC sends an ad hoc message to author, inlcuding the reviews in it by
hand (that is, EiC must copy ans paste the reviews into the message). 

********************************
Ah hoc email from EiC to Authors
********************************

Title: XX

Dear Author:

I am very happy to inform you that your paper has 
successfully passed the first phase of our review process. 
This means that the Editorial Board considers the results of 
your paper significant and of lasting value. 
The referee reports are attached. 

The paper will now undergo a thorough review to check the 
correctness of the results and the exposition. You are not
expected to react to the referee reports at this stage.

With best regards,

XX

Editor-in-Chief, TheoretiCS

--- Reviews ----

b) EiC changes the status of the paper to "Ask for minor revision".
This triggers a customizable message which automatically includes
the reviews (tag %%PAPER_RATINGS%%%). EiC replaces the text of the 
message with the above. Then EiC impersonates one of the authors,
and chooses the option "Reply to the request without any changes".
This changes the status of the paper agin to "Reviewed".

TODO: There is a good chance that Episciences can implement something
to help us with this step. For example, being able to use the tags in
ad hac message would already solve the problem. Antoine has already 
contacted the about this.

6.2 EiC moves the paper to the Phase 2 volume

6.3 EiC makes comment in the paper's page saying that it has 
been moved to the second phase.

6.4 EiC sends ad hoc message to editors asking them to initiate 
the second phase.

********************************
Ah hoc email from EiC to Editors
********************************

Title: XX

Dear XX:

I have now moved the paper to the second phase. Please
notice that you now have to assign referees again, or
``re-use'' the reviewers of the first phase (in their reviews
they have already indicated if they could be available for this).

To assign referees, go to the page of the paper (for example,
by clicking on "Dashboard" in the menu on the left, and then
clicking on the paper's title), and proceed as follows:

- To invite new reviewers, scroll down to the section
"Reviewers" and click on "Invite a reviewer"

- To "re-use" a reviewer for the second phase,
you must first know that the review template consists of two parts, 
labeled "Phase 1" and "Phase 2". Your reviewer has already filled the 
"Phase 1" part. Now the reviewer should access the system again and 
fill the "Phase 2" part too. For this, proceed as follows:

1) Click on the three vertical dots to the left of the reviewer's name,
and select "Allow to edit the reviewing";
2) Click again on the three vertical dots, and select "Contact this reviewer".
An email form appears in the screen.
3) Email the reviewer, asking him or her to review the paper and, when done,
fill the "Phase 2" part of the review template.

The system will not send any automatic reminder asking you to assign 
reviewers, so please act as soon as possible. 

Please give reviewers a deadline. The standard review
time for the second phase is XX months 

With best regards,

XX

Editor-in-Chief, TheoretiCS


PROBLEM: EiCs have to be very careful here, they cannot make 
mistakes.

7) Handling/partner editors assign reviewers for the second phase

Handling/partner editor sends:

TEMPLATE: Reviewing - Invite a user to review an article - existing user 

or

TEMPLATE: Reviewing - Invite a user to review an article - user does not have an account yet

or

TEMPLATE: Reviewing - Invite a user to review an article - existing reviewer

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

8) Reviewers review paper

They see the same grid as above, and fill the 
Phase 2 part of the review template.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


8) Handling/partner editors request major/minor revisions


They change the article status choosing:

I suggest to ask for a minor revision.
I suggest to ask for a major revision.

This trigggers the (customizable) messages

TEMPLATE: Revision requests- Minor revision request

TEMPLATE: Revision requests- Major revision request

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



9) Handling/partner editor suggest acceptance/rejection

They change the article status to one of

I recommend to accept the article
I suggest to reject the aticle


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


10) Editorial Board agrees / does not agree to proposal

The proposal is announced through the "weekly digest".
Editors answer by leaving comments in the paper's page.

10) EiCs accept / reject paper

EiC chooses oe of the options 

"Accept and proceed to copy editing"
"Reject this article"

This triggers the messages 

MESSAGE: Paper-final decision: Accepted article - Author copy 
MESSAGE: Paper-final decision: Accepted article - Editors copy 
MESSAGE: Paper-final decision: Refused article - Author copy 

I have changed the text of the templates of the messages 
for the authors.
