# TheoretiCS Helper for Editors-in-chief

> Authors: Antoine Amarilli, NathanaÃ«l Fijalkow

This document is intended for TheoretiCS editors-in-chief to present the workflow of the
journal, which is a two-phase process. If you want a quick reference of the
workflow, have a look at the flowcharts for [phase 1](detailed-phase1.pdf) and [phase 2](detailed-phase2.pdf).

## Some terminology and basic actions

We first present a terminological note, and information about the two basic
tasks of accessing papers and writing comments.

### Terminology

The journal is hosted by the journal platform Episciences. Some of the
terminology used by the platform is unusual. For instance, a "rating" on the
platform is simply a review.

### Accessing papers

The two most important places are the "Dashboard" and the "Article management" pages.

* The "Dashboard" can be found from the menu on the left.
The "Journal management" tab includes statistics on all papers visible by you.
Clicking on "Manage articles" gets you to the "Article management" page.
The "My assigned papers" tab contains papers you were assigned to as editor.
The "My submissions" tab contains papers you submitted as author.
The "My account" tab lists all your privileges.

* The "Article management" page can be accessed either through the Dashboard or directly from the menu on the left: "Journal" expands into a list including "Article management".
This page lists all of the papers visible by you.
Click on a title to access the paper's page. The first time you access a paper, you will have to declare whether you have a conflict of interest or not.

### Writing comments

You can discuss a paper with fellow editors by leaving comments on the paper's page.
Once you access a paper, scroll down to "Editors comments" to see the comments and write one.

<img src="Comments.png" alt="Comments" width="600"/>

Posted comments are notified by email to the editors assigned to the paper.

Please avoid discussing papers outside of the Episciences system -- it's better
if all information about papers can be centralized on the platform where all
editors and editors-in-chief can access it.

## Following the workflow

We now give a step-by-step explanation of the flowcharts for [phase 1](detailed-phase1.pdf) and [phase 2](detailed-phase2.pdf).

### Authors: submit an article

Authors first submit their work on a repository (HAL or arXiv), and then submit
the paper to the Episciences system.

Authors who do not wish to submit their work to a repository when submitting to
the journal must get in touch with the editors-in-chief directly, so that their
paper can be handled outside the Episciences system.

Another case where the paper should be directly submitted to the
editors-in-chief is for submissions which are in conflict with one of the
editors-in-chief or managing editors (or directly done by them).

### Editors-in-chief: quickly evaluate

* Access the paper (see above)
* The first task with recently submitted papers is to quickly evaluate them.
Click on the paper to access all information. The link for downloading the paper is highlighted in red in the picture below.

<img src="Paper.svg" alt="Access paper" width="600"/>

Judge if the publication process should proceed further or not. If not, reject the article: scroll down to the "Article status" tab and click on "Change article status" then option "Reject this article" (highlighted in red)

<img src="Reject.svg" alt="Reject" width="600"/>

### Editors-in-chief: assign to the volume "Phase 1"

If the publication process should continue, the first task is to assign
the article to Phase 1. To do this, scroll down to the "Volumes and section" tab and change "Master volume" to "Phase 1"

<img src="GoPhase1.png" alt="Go to Phase 1" width="600"/>

### Editors-in-chief: assign handling and partner editors

The second task is to Scroll down to the "Editors" tab and click on "Assign editors" to select two editors.
At this point there is no distinction between Handling and Partner Editor, but
try to assign first the handling editor and then the partner editor (the order
is kept by the system).

<img src="Assign_editors.png" alt="Assign Editors" width="600"/>

### Editors-in-chief: write messages to the editors to indicate roles (handling / partner)

Then, you should send a message to the handling editor. To do this, click on the
mail icon next to their name in the "Editors" tab (highlighted in red below):

<img src="Editor_mailing.svg" alt="Editor mailing" width="600"/>

Change the subject and fill the message (see picture below), according to the text that follows, filling in the blanks NN, XX, YY, and ZZ, adding the date, and changing your signature:

<div style="max-width: 700px; font-family: monospace; font-size: 70%">
--------- VERSION FOR HANDLING EDITOR ------<br/>
<br/>
Subject: TheoretiCS #NN: Handling editor<br/>
<br/>
TITLE: XX<br/>
<br/>
Dear YY:<br/>
<br/>
I would like you to act as handling editor of the above submission to TheoretiCS. <br/>
<br/>
Please login to your editor accounts to start the review process. Click on "Dashboard" and then on the title of the paper to access the paper's page.<br/>
<br/>
Your partner editor is ZZ. You can discuss any action with your partner editor, and the two of you must agree on your final recommendation (see below).<br/>
<br/>
Please communicate with your partner editor through the system if at all possible, either by writing comments in the paper's page or by email (click on the mail icon to the right of the name of the editor in the paper's page). Your partner editor receives the same emails as you from the system.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't assigned at least two reviewers to the paper within two weeks you will start to get automatic reminders. Notice that you can assign yourself and/or your partner editor.<br/>
<br/>
Recall that TheoretiCS follows a two-phase reviewing process. In the first phase, you and your partner editor, usually after seeking the opinion of reviewers, agree on a recommendation: Accept for the second phase, or reject. The main criteria are the significance of the results, the belief that the exposition is of high quality or will be so after revision, and the availability of expert reviewers. The paper moves to the second phase after approval by the Editorial Board. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to ask you to conclude this first phase before<br/>
<br/>
  Date (about current date + 10 weeks) <br/>
<br/>
Our commitment to authors is that they must receive the verdict of the first phase (i.e., acceptance to the second phase, or rejection) within 3 months, including discussion with the board. So please remember that this is a firm deadline to submit your recommendation, evaluating the paper yourself if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
In the second phase, possibly different reviewers check the validity of the results and the presentation. Submissions that pass the first phase are expected to eventually be published, sometimes in revised form, unless significant issues are detected or the desired quality of exposition is not achieved.<br/>
<br/>
With best regards, <br/>
Uri / Javier<br/>
Editor-in-chief<br/>

Now, do the same for the partner editor with the following message:

<div style="max-width: 700px; font-family: monospace; font-size: 70%">

<br/>
Dear YY:<br/>
<br/>
I would like you to act as partner editor of the above submission to TheoretiCS. The handling editor, ZZ, is in charge of conducting the review process, in collaboration with you, and you must make a joint recommendation. <br/>
<br/>
To access the paper, log into your editor account, click on "Dashboard", and then on the title of the paper.<br/>
<br/>

</div>

### Assigned editors: invite reviewers

The editors should now assign reviewers. As long as the number of assigned
reviewers is less than two, they will receive a reminder.

### Editors-in-chief: add a comment to announce the editors

You must wait for the assigned handling editor to react and confirm that
they can handle the submission, first by confirming (when accessing the
submission) that they have no conflict of interest with the submission, then by
performing their work of inviting reviewers (or indicating that they intend to
review the article themselves, by assigning themselves or writing a comment to
that effect). Once the editors have reacted, you can post a comment indicating
again who the confirmed handling/partner editors are. To do this:
* Access the paper (using Dashboard, as above)
* Scroll down to the "Editors comments" tab and add a comment: "Handling Editor: XXX
Partner Editor: YYY
Deadline for recommendation: ZZZ"

<img src="Announce_editors.png" alt="Announce editors" width="600"/>

If an editor has a conflict of interest with the paper, or decides not to handle
the paper, they will get unassigned from the article, and you will receive an
email message. If editors do not invite reviewers, they will receive automatic
reminders (see below). If editors do invite reviewers, the article status
changes to "Under review".

Note that, once an article is submitted, a weekly email digest will invite all
editors to comment on the submission. Comments will trigger an
email notification to the assigned editors (and only them). It is up to the
assigned editors to contact the editors-in-chief if something unexpected arises
based on the comments.

### Editors: take care of the review process for Phase 1

The editors assigned to the article (handling and partner) now take care of
inviting reviewers, etc.

Once the editors have invited reviewers, the paper goes to status "Waiting for
reviewing". Once they have accepted invitations, the paper goes to status "Under
review". With these two last statuses, the paper is waiting for actions from the
reviewers (but the editors should make sure that the reviewers react). Once all
pending reviews are completed, the paper goes back to status "Reviewed" and it
is up to the editor to manage it.

The editors-in-chief should keep an eye on papers assigned to editors, reminding
them to invite reviewers ("Submitted"), to check acceptance of reviewer invitations
("Waiting for reviewing"), to ensure that their reviewers complete their work
in time ("Under review"), or to make a recommendation ("Reviewed").

Once this is done (the paper has status "Reviewed" and the editors do not wish
any more reviews), the editors can propose a decision. For phase 1, this is:
propose to accept, or propose to reject (no revision possible).

Once the editors have proposed a verdict, a weekly digest will invite all
editors to comment on the article. Once this period has elapsed, the editors-in-chief
communicate the decision to the authors.

During all that process, the paper remains in status "Reviewed".

### Editors-in-chief: communicate decision of Phase 1 to the authors

To communicate the decision to the authors:

* Access the paper (using Dashboard, as above)

To reject: 

* Scroll down to the "Article status" tab and click on "Change article status" then option "Reject this article" (highlighted in red)

<img src="Reject.svg" alt="Reject" width="600"/>

To conditionally accept (move to Phase 2) and send the reviews to the authors,
the process is more complicated:

* Scroll down to the "Article status" tab and click on "Ask for a minor revision" (highlighted in red)

<img src="GoPhase2.svg" alt="Ask for a revision for phase 2" width="600"/>

* Replace the text with the message below, changing NN, XX, and your signature in the message.

<div style="max-width: 700px; font-family: monospace; font-size: 70%">
----------- BEGINNING OF EMAIL ------------<br/>
<br/>
Subject: TheoretiCS #NN: Phase 1 results<br/>
<br/>
Title: XX<br/>
<br/>
Dear Author:<br/>
<br/>
I am very happy to inform you that your paper has successfully passed the first phase of our review process. This means that the Editorial Board considers the results of your paper significant and of lasting value. The referee reports are attached. <br/>
<br/>
The paper will now undergo a thorough review to check the correctness of the results and the exposition. You are not expected to react to the referee reports at this stage.<br/>
<br/>
With best regards,<br/>
Uri / Javier<br/>
Editor-in-Chief<br/>
<br/>
----------- END OF EMAIL ------------<br/>
</div>

* Scroll up to the "Contributor" tab and click on the third button (highlighted in red) to spoof the identity of the author

<img src="Spoofing.svg" alt="Spoofing" width="600"/>

* Access the paper (using Dashboard, as above)
* Scroll down to the "Revision requests" tab and click on "Answer this request" and "Answer without any modifications" (highlighted in red)

<img src="AnswerNoRevision.svg" alt="Answer without any modifications" width="600"/>

* Validate the form with a dummy message, e.g., "The article has been accepted
  to phase 2, the assigned editors should now invite phase 2 reviewers"
* Log out, and log in again with your usual account
* Navigate back to the administration page for the paper (the most convenient is
  to do this with the browser history)
* Move the paper to phase 2: scroll down to the "Volumes and section" tab and change "Master volume" to "Phase 2":

<img src="GoPhase2b.png" alt="Move to Phase 2" width="600"/>

* Scroll down to the "Editors comments" tab and add a comment: "Moving the paper to Phase 2."

<img src="Add_comments.png" alt="Add comment: Move to Phase 2" width="600"/>

The paper now still have status "Reviewed".

### Editors: take care of the review process for Phase 2

The editors assigned to the article (handling and partner) now take care of
inviting reviewers, etc. As previously, the paper goes to status "Waiting for
reviewing" once reviewers have been invited, goes to "Under review" when
invitations were accepted, and goes to "Reviewed" once the reviews are completed.

Once this process is finished, the editors can propose a decision. 
For phase 2, this is: propose to accept, propose to reject, ask for minor revisions, or ask for major revisions.

Revision requests are dealt with directly by the editors, without intervention from the editors-in-chief.

Once the editors have proposed a final verdict (acceptance or rejection), a weekly digest will invite all
editors to comment on the article. Once this period has elapsed, the editors
should communicate the decision to the authors.

### Editors-in-chief: communicate decision of Phase 2 to the authors

To communicate the decision to the authors:

* Access the paper (using Dashboard, as above)

To accept or reject: 

* Scroll down to the "Article status" tab and click on "Change article status" to "Accept and proceed to copy editing" or "Reject this article" (both highlighted in red)

<img src="Final_decision.svg" alt="Final decision" width="600"/>

If accepted, the paper then proceeds to the layout editing phase for final
publication.
