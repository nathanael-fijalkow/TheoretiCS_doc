--------- VERSION FOR HANDLING EDITOR ------



Subject: TheoretiCS #**N**: Handling editor

TITLE: **XX**

Dear **YY**:


I would like you to act as handling editor of the above submission to TheoretiCS. 

Please login to your editor accounts to start the review process.
Click on "Dashboard" and then on the title of the paper to access
the paper's page.

Your partner editor is **ZZ**. You can discuss any action with your partner editor,
and the two of you must agree on your final recommendation (see below).

Please communicate with your partner editor through the system if at all
possible, either by writing comments in the paper's page or by
email (click on the mail icon to the right of the name of the editor in the
paper's page). Your partner editor receives the same emails as you from the system.

If you haven't assigned at least two reviewers to the paper within two weeks you 
will start to get automatic reminders. Notice that you can 
assign yourself and/or your partner editor.

Recall that TheoretiCS follows a two-phase reviewing process. 
In the first phase, you and your partner editor, usually after seeking the opinion 
of reviewers, agree on a recommendation: Accept for the second phase, or reject.
The main criteria are the significance of the results, the belief that the exposition 
is of high quality or will be so after revision, and the availability of expert reviewers. 
The paper moves to the second phase after approval by the Editorial Board. 

I would like to ask you to conclude this first phase before

** Date (about current date + 10 weeks) **

In the second phase, possibly different reviewers check the validity of the results and the
presentation. Submissions that pass the first phase are expected to eventually be 
published, sometimes in revised form, unless significant issues are detected or the desired 
quality of exposition is not achieved.

Best regards, Uri/Javier
Editor in chief

Subject: TheoretiCS #**N**: Partner editor

Dear **YY**:

I would like you to act as partner editor of the above submission to TheoretiCS. 
The handling editor, **ZZ**, is in charge of conducting the review process,
in collaboration with you, and you must make a joint recommendation. 

To access the paper, log into your editor account,
click on "Dashboard", and then on the title of the paper.
